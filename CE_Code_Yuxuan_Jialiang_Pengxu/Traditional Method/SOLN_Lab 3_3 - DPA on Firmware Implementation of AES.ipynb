    "**SUMMARY:** *In the previous lab, you saw how a single bit of information can be used to recover an entire byte of the AES key. Remember, this works due to the S-Box being present in the data flow that we are attacking.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Next, we'll see how to use power analysis instead of an actual bit value. With this technique, the goal is to separate the traces by a bit in the result of the SBox output (it doesn't matter which one): if that bit is 1, its group of traces should, on average, have higher power consumption during the SBox operation than the other set.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is all based on the assumption we discussed in the slides and saw in earlier labs: there is some consistent relationship between the value of bits on the data bus and the power consumption in the device.*\n",

    "**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a power measurement to 'validate' a possible device model.\n",
    "* Detecting the value of a single bit using power measurement.\n",
